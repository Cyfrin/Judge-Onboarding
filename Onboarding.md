## Platform Overview

- CodeHawks is a smart contract competitive audit platform which strives to improve the overall security of Web3 through the hosting of Auditing Competitions.

- These competitive, open source audits provide the most thorough and robust assessment of a protocol's codebase out of any pre-deployment security solutions.

- The whole process, from audit submissions to judging is hosted through the CodeHawks portal. The portal contains a number of specific features judges can use to facilitate the assessment process.

## Role of Judges

- **Responsibilities**
  - Assess all submissions of their assigned contest as valid or invalid within a reasonable timeframe
  - Adhere to guidelines provided with respect to judging, ethics and code of conduct
  - Act the part - as a judge for CodeHawks you serve as an ambassador for our community

## Competition Structure

- **Stages of Competition**:

  - **Submission Stage** - Audit contest is active and participants are assessing the codebase and submitting possible vulnerabilities for judgement. This phase's duration varies, but is determined and communicated prior to the contest's announcement

  - **Judging Stage** - Submissions are closed during this period and assessment of the validity of submissions received begins. The judge will closely consider each submission and ultimately determine its validity, leaving supporting comments for their decision in the appropriate space provided.

  - **Appeals Stage** - Once judging concludes, the contest is opened to a 48 hour appeals stage. This period allows participants to raise concerns with preliminary judgments and better support their submission. The judge may choose to begin interacting with appeals during this period to expedite the process.

  - **Appeals Review** - After 48 hours has elapsed, comments on the platform will again be disabled to provide the judge time to review appeals. Once additional considerations have been made based on the submitted appeals, final judgments can be levied for each submission.

  - **Contest Closure** - The final stage is the closure of the contest and distribution of final rewards. Rewards are deposited into winners' wallets with 72 hours of contest closure.

- **Timeline**:
  - **Submission Stage** - Varies by contest, known well in advance.
  - **Judging Stage** - Varies based on number of submissions and complexity of the codebase. Begins immediately following the submission stage.
    - Average duration **~1-2 weeks pending the aforementioned criteria**
  - **Appeals Stage** - 48 hours, announced shortly after the judging stage closes
  - **Appeals Review** - Varies by number of submissions
    - Average duration **~1 week**
  - **Contest Closure** - Instant, occurs upon finalization of the appeals review stage.

## Ethical Guidelines

- **Confidentiality**
  - The nature of this industry is security and the role deals explicitly with vulnerable code. As such, the adage "need to know" should always come into play. We shouldn't discuss the specifics of findings or judgments outside of the scope of the contest unless explicitly necessary. All conversations regarding sensitive topics should be held through secure, adminstrative channels provided
- **Conflict of Interest**
  - In an effort to mitigate conflicts of interest or bias, judges will be disallowed from participating in the contest to which they are assigned. Judges will be compensated as means to account for this restriction ($, XP)
- **Integrity**
  - Upholding these standards ensures a fair, transparent, and respected competition environment. As a judge, adhering to these principles fosters trust and credibility in both the judging process and the competition as a whole.
    - Fairness
      - Impartiality: Avoid favoritism and bias towards any participant.
      - Equal Treatment: Ensure all contestants are judged by the same standards.
    - Transparency
      - Clear Criteria: Make the judging criteria publicly available and understandable.
      - Open Processes: Be transparent about the judging process and decision-making.
    - Confidentiality
      - Privacy Respect: Protect the confidentiality of participants' submissions and personal information.
      - Discretion: Discuss contestants and their work only in appropriate, professional settings.
    - Accountability
      - Responsibility: Acknowledge and own your decisions as a judge.
      - Consistency: Apply rules and criteria consistently throughout the competition.
    - Adherence to Rules and Guidelines
      - Compliance: Strictly adhere to the rules and guidelines set forth by Cyfrin.
      - Updates and Changes: Stay informed about any changes or updates to the competition rules.
